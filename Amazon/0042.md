## Idea: for each position, the water that position can trap is determined by theree factors:
1. that position's height
2. the highest bar to that positions left side
3. the highest bar to its right side
### Navie idea is to use to arrays to track left max and right max for each position
### Optimized solution can calculate bounds on the flay with one pass
