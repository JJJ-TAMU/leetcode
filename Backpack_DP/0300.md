### Idea: Dynamic Programming, input is an array of size n
1. Naive Idea
> Initialize an array of size n, name it dp. We define dp[i] as the length of the LIS ends with nums[i]
> Now, how do you figure out the transition between different states? Suppose we have dp[0], dp[1], dp[2], we can we derive dp[3] given all the previous values? Suppose nums[3] > nums[2], we are sure that by simply adding nums[3] after the LIS ends at dp[2], we get a sequence ends at i of length dp[2] + 1. Similarly, if num[3] > nums[1], we can get as sequence ends at i of length dp[1] + 1. 
> The recurrence formular is: dp[i] = Max(dp[j] + 1) for all j < i and nums[j] < nums[i]

2. Advances idea is to build LIS on fly, we try to make the value at each position of the LIS as small as possible
> we first initialize an empty list, the loop invariant is that the list will be completely sorted
> list[i] represents the smallest ending element we can form with a LIS of length i + 1
> we iterate over the input array, for each element, we check how many elements in the list are strictly smaller than it.
