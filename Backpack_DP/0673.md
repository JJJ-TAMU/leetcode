### Idea: use two arrays, dynamic programming
1. len[i] represents the length of the LIS ends at i
2. count[i] represents the number of LIS ends at i
3. finally, according to len, we get the length of LIS in the array
4. after we get length of LIS, we use count and len to count total number of LIS with length in array
