### Idea: for each middle window, we gonna find the max window in its left side, and the max window in its right side
1. for the first array middle, middle[i] represents the value of window int range [i - k + 1, i]
2. for the second arrary left, left[i] represents the starting index of the array which has the biggest value (smallest index first)
3. for the third array right, right[i] represents the starting index of the array which has the biggest value (smallest index first)
