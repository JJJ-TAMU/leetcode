#### Idea
> Given capital w, the best strategy is to choose the project which produce maximal profit with capital requirement <= w
> Probably, we need a max heap to maintain those projects with capital requirement <= w, and sort them by profit
> Also, we know that, as we finish projects, our capital w is gonna increase
> We need annother min heap to maintain those projects with capital requirement > k
> whenever we increase the capital w, we check if there are more projects with cap req <= k, and add them into the max pq
