#### Idea: find the largest element which is smaller than x and the first which is >= x
1. suppose a is the largest element which is < x, its index is i
2. suppose b is the smallest element which is >= x, its inde is j (j = i + 1)
3. we compare a and b to find which one is closer to x, if a is closer, move i leftward, else move j rightwwrad
4. until there are engough elements between i and j
